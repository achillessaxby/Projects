# UInotebooks

## November 10 2016. Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class. No instances of harassment or attempts to marginalize students will be tolerated in my class. If you have concerns please come talk to me


This is a repo contains ALL code generated for [Principles of Urban Informatics Class at NYU CUSP Fall 2016](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/PUI2016/) for all the lectures taught by [FBB](http://fbb.space). 

(previous years: [2015 is here ](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/UI_CUSP_2015))

For the current homework sets and labs go to [this](http://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55) Github repo.



This repo includes notebooks that will be explored in class, notebooks to be used as templates for lab sessions, and notebooks that generate plots used in the class, and class slides.

To run the notebooks, make sure that you have a directory for the plots, and outputs to be stored in, identified by environmental variables PUI2015, PUI15PLOTS, PUI2016 etc, as needed.

Numerous python packages are needed: numpy, scipy, sklearn, statsmodules, pandas. Mostly I try to be PEP8 compliant, but I am sloppy sometimes (while you should never be!). 

If you are a PUI student you may want to make a copy of this repository, and you definitely want to check for updates regularly.

If you just want to have your own copy of the repository on your machine what you want to do it __clone__ the repository on your machine as
```
git clone https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks.git
```
That way if I make changes you can update them locally on your machine with 
```
git pull
```
but you will not be able to make changes to my repository (as it should be).

Otherwise, if you want the repository on your account, with the ability to  make changes _to your own copy_, you can __fork__ the repository and have your own copy in your github account (it will be at http://github.com/<username>/PUI2016_fb55). In which case you want to _keep it synchronized_ following these instructions to [coniguting a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
 
 _If you see a mistake (there are many of course) and you want to propose a change you can submit a pull request, but be very clear about the change and it motivation in the description of your pull request, otherwise I will likely dismiss it as something you did accidentally._
