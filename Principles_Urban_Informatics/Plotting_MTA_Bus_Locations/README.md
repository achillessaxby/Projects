# PUI2016_aes807: HW-2

## Achilles Edwin Alfred Saxby - aes807

## Assignment - 1 : show_bus_locations_aes807.py
#### Practice code also published here - Assignment_1 - Coding Practice.ipynb

- Created a Python script that can be run from any terminal as long as they are in this directory itself.
- The two(2) inputs that will be given are already taken into consideration to give the desired output.

## Assignment - 2: get_bus_info_aes807.py
#### Practice code also published here - Assignment_2 - Coding Practice.ipynb

- Created in the same way as the first - only difference is that there are two more variables for the input and output.

## Assignment - 3:
#### Practice code is the main code and it is published here under Assignment_3_Solutions_aes807.ipynb

## Assignment - Extra Credit:
#### The code is on github and the practice code is on jupyter.

- Did not work on it by myself at all - used help from Vishwajeet and basically copied his whole code because I could not figure out how the date/time format worked out in the problem.
- The code is an exact match of Vishwajeet - I was trying to learn and understand but since I created it - I pushed it to github.

## Lab-2 - Used as a guideline to complete the assignments.

### People collaborated with:

1. Federica Bianco (Instuctor) - Taught me how to run a simple python script and the steps to follow to achieve the same
2. Hrafnkell Hjorleifsson (Worked with him on all three assignments - figuring out ways and methods)
3. Vishwajeet Shelar (Helped me in the extra-credit assignment)

### Helped:

1. Akshay Penmarcha (Worked on all three assignments - only giving instructions and small ideas on how to write the code and complete the work) - also helped him extensively in the Assignmet 3 and the Extra_Credit_Assignment helping him understand and complete his code/assignment
2. Priyanshi Singh (Worked on all three assignments - only giving instructions and small ideas on how to write the code and complete the work)
3. Aaron Jude Simon D'Souza (Worked on assignments - only giving instructions and small ideas on how to write the code and complete the work)
4. Vishwajeet Shelar (Helped in giving small ideas about code in the third assignment)

Using the directions given in the NYU Classes and the Assignments, following them and collaborating with the people mentioned above:

    - PUI2016_aes807 - HW2_aes807
    - Extra_Files - for all the extra files used to understand the problem
    - CSV Files - to store all the .csv files that have been used and/or created whilst doing the assignments

All the files taken and stored in the Jupyter notebooks under the /homedirs/aes807/PUI2016 folders.
