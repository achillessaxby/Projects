Using the directions given in the NYU Classes and the Assignments, following them and collaborating with the team mentioned above, I have created two repositories in GitHub(achillessaxby)
    - gittest_achilles - Laboratory1
    - PUI2016_aes807 - HW1_aes807 - Assignments 1/2/3 
    - PUI2016_aes807 - HW1_3_aes807

Also, using the fork/clone/merge directions - everything completed successfully in github - with gittest_dfay_repo with Daniel Fay - merged with Daniel and can be seen on repo - achillessaxby.

All the files and screenshots have been taken and stored in the Jupyter notebooks under the /homedirs/aes807/PUI2016 folders.

The LAB and Assignment(1) - completed on my local machine - on repo - github/achillessaxby/gittest_achilles.

Assignment(2) - started, completed on Jupyter through compute.

Assignment(3) - started, completed and updated.
