# ---------------------- 

## Assignment 1:
### Markdown file for the Assignment_1 of Homework_4 is attached in the main (HW4_aes807) repository as (Assignment_1.md)
#### (aes807) to create and complete the evaluation of Xinge Zhong - (xz1809)
#### Forked, Cloned and Written .md file

# ---------------------- 

## Assignment 2: 

### Worked with Priyanshi Singh (ps3369) on this assignment
### We worked in conjunction and discussion throughtout the assignment

### Part - I (Choosing two from the First Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved both MANCOVA and ANCOVA tests - so I thought it would be best to use this paper so that I can get exposed and learn about how both can be used simultaneously and how two different tests are clubbed togeather to show a single result.

#### Here MANCOVA's were used first and ANCOVA's were used inside/follow up of the MANCOVA tests to determine/understand certain Interdependent qualities

MANCOVA	| 3, Patients / Relatives / Controls | Categorical | 2, breathing rates and depth / HRV and cardio-respiratory coupling| Continuous | 1, stress-related changes of cardio-respiratory function | Continuous (could also be categorical) | 	Hypothesized that increased breathing rates and reduced cardio-respiratory coupling in patients with acute schizophrenia would be associated with low vagal function | Cardio-respiratory coupling was reduced in patients and healthy relatives also, while HRV was increased in patients and healthy relatives in comparison to controls | Cardio-respiratory coupling was reduced in patients only, while HRV was decreased in patients and healthy relatives in comparison to controls | 0.001 | [The Phrenic Component of Acute Schizophrenia – A Name and Its Physiological Reality](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033459) |

### Part - II (Choosing one from the Second Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved the Logistic Regression test. Here this uses archaeological data to relate the variable that is highly affected by the change in the Independent Variables.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION	| 2, the absence or presence of colony fissioning is considered expression of not critical vs. critical level of scalar stress | Categorical | 1, Community Size | Dichotomous | N/A Here (NIL) | N/A Here (0) | Drawing upon the cognitive constrains to human group size, a model is built by means of Logistic Regression on the basis of the data on colony fissioning among the Hutterites of North America | On the grounds of the theoretical framework sketched in the first part of the article, the absence or presence of colony fissioning is considered expression of not critical vs. critical level of scalar stress for the sake of the model building| Does not show a significant relationship between the critical scalar stress and group size | Confirms the existence of a significant relationship between critical scalar stress and group size, setting the issue on firmer statistical grounds | 0.05 | [Modeling Group Size and Scalar Stress by Logistic Regression from an Archaeological Perspective](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510) |

## Assignment 3:

- Copied and pasted the notebook into my personal notebook and worked on it from compute directly - did not use the same notebook as the instructor - this might show some irregularities with the code and the boxes that needed to be completed.

- Worked on the assignment from the instructors notes and used code to fill up the blanks in the code.

- Used Google and help from other students in the class to understand the coding aspect of writing statistics - code may be similar to a few people due to the help I have taken from them.

- Read friends' codes to try and understand how to frame sentences for proving in words why the rejection/acceptance was done for a particular hypothesis.
