# PUI2016_aes807: HW-3

## Achilles Edwin Alfred Saxby - aes807

## Assignment - 1 : Assignment_1_Solutions_aes807.ipynb
#### Distributions (5 in Total) and a Histogram of all the means of all the distributions taken at once
 -  Chi-Square Distribution
 -  Normal Distribution
 -  Poisson Distribution
 -  Binomial Distribution
 -  Logistic Distribution
 -  Histogram of all Distributions
 
#### Extra Credit - adding a Gaussian Curve to the Histogram - In the same iPython notebook itself.

## Assignment - 2: Assignment_2_Solutions_aes807.ipynb
#### Had to work in a group specifically for this assignment
    -  Group work done and totally six(6) people in the group collaborated and worked on this project
    -  Group members:
        - Anastasia Shegay
        - Vishwajeet Shelar
        - Akshay Penmatcha
        - Aaron D'Souza
        - Priyanshi Singh
        - Achilles E A Saxby (aes807)
    -  Togeather the group has created the assignment/sat down together and created the code/worked togeather throughout
    -  Data is downloaded onto everyone's personal homedirs/ under their NetID aliases - using the code the instructor used to download the same
    -  All group members worked together and created the project from scratch and the same has been submitted by everyone with minor changes in the code depending on personal changes that needed to be reflected

## Assignment - 3: Assignment_3_Solutions_aes807.ipynb
#### Completed Lab Work - (Z-Score) and formally introduced the problem and the Z-Test and solved to prove

-  The "times.txt" file is in the location of the HW3 folder itself and has been pushed to this repository as well for the purpose of the smooth running of the code

#### Rough Solutions for the Assignment_2 is also in this repository to show the working of how we tried to download the data in different ways to try and run the code for the 2nd Assignment
#### This code is on github and on jupyter as well

### People collaborated with:

1. Federica Bianco (Instuctor) - Used code given to run and work on all assignments
2. Vishwajeet Shelar - helped in understanding most of the code in Assignment_2 and Assignment_3
3. Christian Rosado - helped us in understanding and figuring out the details and schematics of the Assignment_2

### Worked together with:

1. Akshay Penmarcha (Worked on all three assignments - giving instructions and small ideas on how to write the code and complete the work) - also helped him extensively in the Assignment_1 and Assignment_3 relating to coding and ideas of plotting and distributions
2. Priyanshi Singh (Worked on all three assignments)
3. Aaron D'Souza (Worked on assignments - taking help and helping too)
4. Vishwajeet Shelar (Helped in giving small ideas about code in the third assignment)
5. Anastasia (Worked in conjunction for the group assignment)

Using the directions given in the NYU Classes and the Assignments, following them and collaborating with the people mentioned above:

    - PUI2016_aes807 - HW3_aes807

All the files taken and stored in the Jupyter notebooks under the /homedirs/aes807/PUI2016/HW3_aes807 folders.
